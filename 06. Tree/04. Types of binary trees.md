# Types of Binary Tree -

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They are hierarchical structures where each node has at most two children. Here’s an in-depth look at the different types of binary trees:

### 1. **Basic Binary Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
- **Properties**: There are no constraints on the arrangement of nodes other than the binary tree structure.

### 2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

- **Definition**: A binary tree where for each node, the left child contains nodes with values less than the node’s value, and the right child contains nodes with values greater than the node’s value.
- **Properties**: 
  - In-order traversal of a BST results in a sorted sequence of values.
  - Allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with average time complexity of O(log n).
- **Example**:
  
  ```
     10
    /  \
   5   15
  / \    \
  2   7   20
  ```

### 3. **Balanced Binary Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree where the height of the two subtrees of any node differs by at most one.
- **Types**:
  - **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing BST where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Rotations are used to maintain balance during insertions and deletions.
  - **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing BST with an additional color property (red or black) for each node. Ensures that no path from the root to a leaf is more than twice as long as any other such path.
- **Properties**:
  - Guarantees O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

### 4. **Complete Binary Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree in which all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
- **Properties**: 
  - The last level is filled from left to right.
  - Used in heap data structures.
- **Example**:
  
  ```
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \
  4   5
  ```

### 5. **Full Binary Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree in which every node other than the leaf nodes has exactly two children.
- **Properties**:
  - All internal nodes have either 0 or 2 children.
- **Example**:
  
  ```
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \ / \
  4  5 6  7
  ```

### 6. **Perfect Binary Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree where all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
- **Properties**:
  - It is both full and complete.
  - The number of nodes at each level is a power of 2.
- **Example**:
  
  ```
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \ / \
  4  5 6  7
  ```

### 7. **Degenerate (or pathological) Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree where each parent node has only one child, creating a structure similar to a linked list.
- **Properties**:
  - The height of the tree is equal to the number of nodes.
  - Operations such as insertion and search degrade to O(n) time complexity.
- **Example**:
  
  ```
     1
      \
       2
        \
         3
          \
           4
  ```

### 8. **Threaded Binary Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree where the null pointers (if any) are replaced with pointers to the in-order predecessor or successor.
- **Types**:
  - **Single Threaded**: Null pointers point to the in-order predecessor or successor.
  - **Double Threaded**: Null pointers can point to both the in-order predecessor and successor.
- **Properties**:
  - Facilitates faster in-order traversal without using a stack or recursion.

### 9. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**

- **Definition**: A special type of tree used to store associative data structures, often strings.
- **Properties**:
  - Each node represents a single character of a string.
  - Commonly used for autocomplete and spell-checking algorithms.

### 10. **Segment Tree**

- **Definition**: A binary tree used for storing intervals or segments. It allows querying and updating intervals efficiently.
- **Properties**:
  - Often used for range queries like finding the sum or minimum in a range of an array.

Understanding these different types of binary trees and their properties will help you choose the appropriate structure based on your needs and optimize your algorithms effectively.
